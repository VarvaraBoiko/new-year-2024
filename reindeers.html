        Santa's reindeers are legendary companions that help him deliver gifts to children around the world on Christmas Eve. According to popular
         folklore and the poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas" (commonly known as "The Night Before Christmas"), 
        Santa's reindeers are a crucial part of his magical team. Here are the names of Santa's reindeers:
        Dasher: Known for his speed and agility, Dasher is one of the front-runners in Santa's sleigh team.
        Dancer: This reindeer is graceful and lively, adding a touch of elegance to the sleigh.
        Prancer: With a lively and spirited demeanor, Prancer is another member of the energetic front line.
        Vixen: Often depicted as female, Vixen is known for her beauty and agility.
        Comet: This reindeer is associated with speed, ensuring that Santa can cover vast distances quickly.
        Cupid: Known for spreading love and joy, Cupid's presence adds a touch of warmth to the sleigh team.
        Donner/Donder: The name varies, but this reindeer is often associated with thunder or strength.
        Blitzen: This reindeer is known for its speed and agility, helping Santa navigate the skies efficiently.
        Rudolph: While not originally part of the classic reindeer lineup, Rudolph is a modern addition, thanks to the famous song "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." Rudolph's
         bright red nose serves as a guiding light through foggy weather.
        These names have become iconic, and the image of Santa's sleigh being pulled by this team of reindeers has become deeply ingrained in
         Christmas traditions. Each reindeer is said to contribute their unique qualities to ensure a successful and magical Christmas journey.
