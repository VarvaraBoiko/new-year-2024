    Ukrainian New Year traditions are rich in customs and rituals. Here are some key aspects of how Ukrainians celebrate the New Year:
    New Year's Eve Feast (Sviata Vecheria): Similar to Christmas, Ukrainians celebrate the New Year with a festive dinner on New Year's Eve. The meal often includes traditional dishes such as kutia (sweet grain pudding),
     borscht (beet soup), and a variety of meat and fish dishes.
    Decorations: Homes are adorned with festive decorations, including a New Year tree, similar to a Christmas tree. People often decorate the tree with ornaments, lights, and garlands.
    Countdown to Midnight: Ukrainians eagerly await the stroke of midnight to welcome the New Year. The moment is marked by the chiming of the clock, and people exchange greetings and good wishes.
    New Year's Toasts: As the clock strikes midnight, it's customary to make toasts to the New Year. People raise their glasses and wish each other good health, happiness, and success in the coming year.
    Fireworks and Celebrations: Many cities and towns organize public events with fireworks displays to celebrate the arrival of the New Year. People gather in central squares to enjoy the festivities.
    New Year's Resolutions: Like in many cultures, Ukrainians often make New Year's resolutions, setting personal goals and aspirations for the upcoming year.
     First Footer: It is considered lucky if the first person to enter a home after the stroke of midnight is a young, dark-haired man, bringing good fortune for the coming year.
     Fortune-Telling: Some Ukrainians engage in traditional fortune-telling practices on New Year's Eve to predict their future. This can involve various rituals and superstitions.
    Holiday Greetings: Ukrainians exchange New Year's greetings and cards with wishes for prosperity, joy, and fulfillment in the coming year.
     Caroling: In some regions, groups of carolers go from house to house, singing New Year carols and spreading joy and good wishes.
     These traditions vary across regions and families, but collectively they contribute to a festive and meaningful New Year celebration in Ukraine.
